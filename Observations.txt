As far as trends go, I noticed that the purpose statements that scored the most negative had a heavy emphasis on words such as "Killer". There were a lot of company purpose statements that had neutral values; this made sense to me as well. Corporate slogans are often geared to be either upbeat or, more frequently, deadpan. It makes sense then that the sentiment of 98% of the statements falls into one of these brackets; nobody wants to have their company mission statement give the reader a bad connotation. I performed a similar analysis using hundreds of thousands of data points from Twitter where users were discussing the recent performance of their favorite sports team and got much more polarized results; a more emotional issue leads to a more emotional response.
